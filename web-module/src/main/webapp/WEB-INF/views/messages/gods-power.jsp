                <p><h4>Introduction:</h4>
Judges 15:15 Samson killed 1000 people with the Jaw bone of Ass.
                </p>
                <p>The god’s power is given to the people whom put their trust in him and obey his words. Bible says that in Judges Chapter 15:14 “When he came to Lehi, the philistines shouted as they met him. And the spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily so that the ropes that were on his arms were as flat that is burned with fire, and his bonds dropped from his hands.”  </p>
                <p>God exhibits his power for those who are weak in their spirit; they are capable to overcome this world by the spirit of the God. Think about David he was a small boy not even able to carry a big sword but still he was able to defeat Goliath a big giant of Philistine. God’s exhibited his power in Egypt to deliver his people from captivity and kings of pharaoh could not withstand the destruction sent by god. God had a strong desire to move his people from captivity as they struggling in Egypt for quite long time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                One day I was having a meeting with my senior managers and when there was a session on questions the seniors were ready to ask me questions about the execution of the project. I was afraid of answering to my managers. Because all of them will scold me in any ways if they find a reason against me. At that time I felt a power coming from heaven and I realized that there was someone coming with a mighty power inside that meeting room. When I felt that the senior managers stopped asking questions and they said let us close the meeting and it ended in few minutes. I was wondering about the power of God and then thinking about the favor he has done to me.
                </p>
                <p>Jesus said that if you have faith you will overcome all problems and nothing is impossible as God power will be with us when we submit everything according to the will of God and put the trust in the LORD. This is the reference taken from Mark 9:23 “And Jesus said to him, “If you can’! All things are possible for one who believes.” 
                </p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                LORD is powerful to lead us through all situations if we have a fear of LORD and obey his commandments and have a loving heart for him and his word.  If we have the same level of respect to him and his word , our life shall be blessed.  John 14: 23 says that “Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him”.
                </p>
                <h4>Prayer</h4>
                <p>Lord thanks for the cross that you have taken for us and thanks for all your mercy that has led us through this tough situations and we overcame all the difficulties with your spirit and your loving kindness. Lead us through your path and teach us to walk according to your words. Your word endures forever and let us have a life that is lasting ever more by taking your word in us. Lead us not into temptations and let us be very far away from sins and worldly pleasures. We pray for your power and we wait for you to deliver from those tough situations that we come across. Kindly hold us in your hands as we pass through events coming in our life. Speak to us if we are making any mistakes which we have not thought through well before. Let your mercy be upon us. Amen.</p>
