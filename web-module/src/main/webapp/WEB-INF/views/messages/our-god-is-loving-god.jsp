                <h4 class="post-title"><a href="#">Our GOD is a loving GOD <span>3</span></a></h4>
                <p><h4>Introduction:</h4>
John 3:16 (KJV)  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
                </p>
                <p>Our LORD has given Jesus Christ his son to save the people locked by sin and bondages for years. His love was so abundant that he gave his only son Jesus Christ to be crucified in the cross and all humans can be saved by his blood. You may wonder why the lord has to die in the cross to save people from sin? . In the olden days people considered sacrificing goats and calves made them clean. The blood of goats and bulls where sprinkled on them who are ceremonially unclean and then sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. </p>
                <p>For this reason Christ has shed his own blood to sanctify those whom he called and inherit the eternal life. As per the bible scripture written in <i>Hebrews 9:22 The law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</i> Christ himself exhibited as high priest for the upcoming good things. And died only once and shed his blood to give the everlasting redemption and forgiveness.</p>
                <p>Our god is a loving god that he forgives he sends rain and allows the light to shine upon all living things, He is the god who forgive our sins if we declare it to him and never turn back on that again. And his mercy shall follow him from generations to generations. Bible says his mercy endures for ever and ever and it is so long as the distance between east to west. Christ has provided all our needs as he does for any other livings things in this world and he says we are so special than the birds. </p>
                <h4>Joy of salvation</h4>
                <p>Our LORD has provided us the joy of salvation and the faith that we may seek him daily in the morning and praise him for what he done so far and for the things that are yet to come. The anointing given by the holy spirit helps to understand that we are his children and help us in 
practicing the word of god and he teach us the goodness of keeping his word every day. His word is ever true as we see the covenant of peace he has done with us. And that makes our life easy every day. 
                </p>
                <p>His love has made us change our life totally and we do not see the darkness around us. Our mind does not even plan to think about the evil things as we were doing before. His great mercies had allowed us to pass over the tough situations like a drought, financial crisis and his grace was enough to us to withstand them at that period. And now we realize that whatever got provided has overcome this world and we reached that point by the faith we had in him.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Just think how you feel when we see our own son dying in front of us. Then we will realize his love on this sinful world. God loved this world so much that he gave his only son for the redemption of sinners like us to get into an everlasting life. He did not sin nor trouble anyone in this world but still he was crucified as written in bible already. (Isaiah -53). The place he had called us does not have any trouble, heat and agony. And it is a place of glory and rejoicing. So keep praying to the LORD and get his forgiveness and walk in his ways by taking the cross every day.</p>
                <h4>Prayer</h4>
                <p>LORD we come to you today as we understand that you have shed your own blood to give a redemption from sins and freedom from our bondage. I submit and surrender myself unto you. Forgive me for all the sins I have done. Thanks for the covenant that you have made by your blood and that covenant makes our daily life easier. Please continue in leading us through your word and the holy spirit. LORD have your way in my life and we wish you lead us through all our life. And finally take us to your home as you have promised and we also like to there with you. Amen.</p>
