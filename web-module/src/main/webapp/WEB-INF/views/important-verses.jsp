                  							<li>But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness! <b>Mathew 6:23 </b></li>

                  							<h4>I Corinthians 7:1-4</h4>
                  							<li>It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</li>
                  							<li>Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. </li>
                  							<li>Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.</li>

											<a href="#">Rightenousness</a>
										</h3>
										<div>
										<ul>
										<li>You shall do no injustice in judgment. You shall not be partial to the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty. In righteousness you shall judge your neighbor. Leviticus 19:15</li>
										<li>Light is sown for the righteous,And gladness for the upright in heart. Psalm 97:11</li>
										<li>Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous,And give thanks at the remembrance of His holy name. Psalm 97:12</li>
										<li>Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink: , Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him! Isaiah 5:22,23</li>

										<h3>
											<a href="#"></a> Helping Others
										</h3>
										<div>
											<h4>Luke 10:30-37</h4>
											<ul>
											<li>In reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. </li> 
											<li> A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. </li>
											<li> So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</li>
											<li> But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.</li>
											<li> He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.</li>
											<li>The next day he took out two denarii[c] and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'</li>
											<li>'Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?'</li>
											<li>The expert in the law replied, 'The one who had mercy on him.'</li>
											<li>Jesus told him, 'Go and do likewise.'</li>											
											</ul>
											
										</div>

										<h3>
											<a href="#">Love one another</a>
										</h3>
										<div>
											<ul>
											<li>He answered, Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind; and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' <b>Luke 10:27</b></li>
											
											</ul>
											<h4>I Corinthians 13:1-8</h4>
											<ul>
											<li>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.</li>
											<li>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</li>
											<li>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned,[a] but have not love, it profits me nothing.</li>
											<li>Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up;</li>
											<li>does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil;</li>
											<li>does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;</li>
											<li>bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</li>
											<li>Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away.</li>
											
											</ul>
										</div>


										<h3>
											<a href="#">Judgement and Punishments</a>
										</h3>
										<div>
										<ul>
										<li>For God will bring every work into judgment,Including every secret thing,Whether good or evil. <b>Ecclesiastes 12:14</b></li>
										<li>But with righteousness He shall judge the poor,And decide with equity for the meek of the earth;He shall strike the earth with the rod of His mouth,And with the breath of His lips He shall slay the wicked. <b>Isaiah 11:4</b></li>
										<li>"There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out. </b>Luke 13:28</b></li>
										<li>The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom every cause of sin and all who practice lawlessness. <b>Mathew 13:41</b></li>
										<li>And they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <b>Mathew 13:42</b></li>
										<li><hr></li>
										<h4>Luke 16:24-31</h4>
										<li>'Then he cried and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.'</li>
										<li>But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and you are tormented.</li>
										<li>And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can those from there pass to us.'</li>
										<li>'Then he said, 'I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father’s house,</li>
										<li>for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment.'</li>
										<li>Abraham said to him, 'They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.'</li>
										<li>And he said, 'No, father Abraham; but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'</li>
										<li>But he said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rise from the dead.'</li>									
										</ul>
										</div>


										<h3>
											<a href="#">Coming of Jesus</a>
										</h3>
										<div>
											 <h4>For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Mathew 24:27</h4>	
										     <h4>Mathew 24</h4>
										     <ul>
										     <li>4. Jesus answered: 'Watch out that no one deceives you. </li> <li>5. For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah,' and will deceive many.</li><li> 6. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.</li><li> 7. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.</li> <li>8. All these are the beginning of birth pains.</li>
										     <li>9. 'Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.</li> <li>10. At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other,</li> <li>11. and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.</li><li> 12. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold,</li> <li>13. but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.</li><li> 14. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.</li>
										     </ul> 
											<h4>I Thessalonians 4:13-18</h4>
											<ul>
											<li>But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope.</li>
											<li>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.[b]</li>
											<li>For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep.</li>
											<li>For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first.</li>
											<li>Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.</li>
											<li>Therefore comfort one another with these words.<li>
